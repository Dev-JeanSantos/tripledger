# ADR-002 — API REST Design

## Context

TripLedger will expose functionality via REST APIs. The system must:

- Support CRUD operations for Trips, Expenses, Checklist Items, and Users
- Be modular and maintain strict separation of concerns
- Serve as a portfolio demonstration of backend skills
- Allow future integration with microservices

---

## Decision

The system will expose **REST endpoints** for each module:

- Trip Module
- Expense Module
- Checklist Module
- User Module

Endpoints will follow **resource-based URIs** and **HTTP semantics**:

- GET → read
- POST → create
- PUT/PATCH → update
- DELETE → delete

All endpoints will be documented using **OpenAPI / Swagger**.

---

## Rationale

REST is chosen for:

- Simplicity
- Widely understood conventions
- Easy integration with front-end or future microservices
- Fast prototyping

GraphQL or gRPC were considered but rejected due to unnecessary complexity at this stage.

---

## Consequences

- Strong separation of adapters from domain logic
- Clear input/output contracts
- Ready for API documentation and testing
- Easy to extend or version later
